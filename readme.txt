== Description ==

**Please note that version 2.5.6.1 is the very last one issued under the WP ImageTagger denomination. This plugin is now obsoleted by WP MediaTagger, that  addresses much more than image tagging. Any media supported by WordPress is eligible to the same tagging methodology deployed with ImageTagger. WP MediaTagger is [available on this page](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-mediatagger/ "WP MediaTagger, an evolution of WP ImageTagger"). WP MediaTagger is developped in such a way that migration is totally transparent, "1-click" style.**
